# Aether File Compilation Testing System

## Overview

The Aether File Compilation Testing System is a comprehensive framework designed to validate the Aether compiler by automatically discovering, compiling, and testing all Aether source files (.ae) in the project. This system serves as both a regression testing framework and a validation system for the compiler's functionality.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

1. **Automatic File Discovery**: Recursively scans the project directory to find all .ae files
2. **Test File Generation**: Creates additional Aether test files covering various language features
3. **Batch Compilation**: Uses the existing aetherc compiler to build executables
4. **Execution Validation**: Runs generated executables and captures results
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Produces detailed reports of compilation and execution results

### Advanced Features

- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of compilation and execution failures
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent compilation and execution for improved performance
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files and artifacts
- **Multiple Report Formats**: Console, JSON, HTML, and Markdown output
- **Configurable Testing**: Customizable test categories and parameters

println!("Test Results:");
println!("Total files: {}", report.summary.total_files);

```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Run all tests
aether-test-runner --all

# Test specific directories
aether-test-runner --dirs examples,tests

# Generate additional tests only
aether-test-runner --generate-only

# Custom output format
aether-test-runner --format json --output results.json

# Verbose mode with detailed logging
aether-test-runner --verbose --log-level debug
```

## Configuration

### TestingConfig Structure

```rust
pub struct TestingConfig {
    /// Root directory of the project to scan for Aether files
    pub project_root: PathBuf,
    
    /// Path to the aetherc compiler executable
    pub compiler_path: PathBuf,
    
    /// Directory for output files (executables, reports, generated tests)
    pub output_directory: PathBuf,
    
    /// Directories to include in testing
    pub test_directories: Vec<String>,
    
    /// Timeout for compilation operations
    pub compilation_timeout: Duration,
    
    /// Timeout for executable execution
    pub execution_timeout: Duration,
    
    /// Whether to generate additional test files
    pub generate_additional_tests: bool,
    
    /// Categories of tests to generate
    pub test_categories: Vec<TestCategory>,
    
    /// Format for the final report
    pub report_format: ReportFormat,
    
    /// Whether to clean up temporary artifacts after testing
    pub cleanup_artifacts: bool,
    
    /// Maximum number of parallel compilation processes
    pub max_parallel_compilations: usize,
    
    /// Maximum number of parallel execution processes
    pub max_parallel_executions: usize,
    
    /// Enable verbose logging
    pub verbose: bool,
}
```

## Generated Test Files

The system automatically generates comprehensive test files covering:

### Core Language Features
- Basic function definitions and calls
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Pattern matching
- Module imports and exports

### Type System Features
- Gradual typing examples
- Dependent type usage (tensor shapes)
- Linear type ownership
- Type inference validation

### AI-Specific Features
- Tensor operations and manipulations
- Automatic differentiation examples
- Probabilistic programming constructs
- GPU kernel definitions

### Error Handling
- Syntax error cases
- Type error scenarios
- Runtime error conditions
- Edge case handling

## Error Handling and Recovery

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

### Error Recovery Strategies
1. **Compilation Failures**: Continue with remaining files, collect all errors
2. **Execution Failures**: Capture error details, continue with other executables
3. **File Generation Failures**: Skip problematic templates, continue with others
4. **Timeout Handling**: Kill processes after timeout, mark as failed

### Graceful Degradation
- Partial file discovery when full discovery fails
- Core language test generation when full generation fails
- Individual file processing when batch processing fails

## Performance Considerations

### Parallel Processing
- Compile multiple files concurrently using thread pool
- Execute multiple tests in parallel with resource limits
- Generate test files concurrently when possible

### Resource Management
- Limit concurrent compilations to avoid resource exhaustion
- Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
- Clean up temporary files and artifacts automatically

### Caching
- Cache compilation results for unchanged files
- Store test file generation results
- Reuse executable validation results when appropriate

## Security Considerations

- Sandbox executable execution to prevent system damage
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Limit resource usage (memory, CPU, disk) for safety
- Implement proper cleanup of temporary files

## Integration

### Build System Integration
- Integrates with existing Cargo build process
